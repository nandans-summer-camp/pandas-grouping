    "\n",
    "One pattern to make your code more legible, and to make it easier to break down big problems, is to ensure that your code can be read on two levels: one \"declarative\" level, where someone can read (or write) *what* will happen and another \"imperative level\", where someone can read (or write!) *how* the thing is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation often involves a \"pipeline\", a uni-directional flow of transformations where the data is moved, one step at a time, towards the final format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important, when you try to create a pipline, which can be a big problem, to make a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make a plan is to start from the final goal, and ask write out the following statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"If I had ________ (INPUT), then it would be easy to make [FINAL GOAL], I would just need to ________ (step).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you should think of INPUT as \"data ______ in data structure ______\".\n",
    "\n",
    "That will be the final step of your pipeline. Now repeat the statement, with the FINAL GOAL being replaced with the INPUT of the previous step: \n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"If I had ________ (INPUT), then it would be easy to make [PREVIOUS INPUT], I would just need to ________ (step).\"\n",
